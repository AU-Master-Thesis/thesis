The  ...

All work on the reproduction part is done by assessment of the openly available material i.e. the paper@gbpplanner and openly available source code distributed along with it.

No communication made with the authors


Where behaviour is not self evident, and not described in both the paper@gbpplanner and the source code@gbpplanner-code a point will be made with a clear reference to the source from which the knowledge was derived from. Where things are stated in an ambiguous way an explation/argument for the chosen interpretation will be made.

=== Expectations <s.m.expectations>

As a result of the tracking factor, $f_t$, design it is expected that the variables will be pulled towards the path, $P$, in a similar way that the interrobot factor, $f_i$, pushes the variables apart. This should show itself in a lower path deviation error than before.

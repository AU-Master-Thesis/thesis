This section covers the methodology for #study.H-2.prefix. The concept of internal and external iteration scheduling is described in @s.iteration-schedules. An experiment to test the effect of the introduced concept is presented and discussed in @s.r.study-2. These two complete research objectives #boxed(color: theme.green, [*O-2.1.1*]), while the corresponding results in @s.r.study-2 and the following discussion provides closure for #boxed(color: theme.green, [*O-2.2.1*]). Hereafter, different ideas for internally representing the graph are deliberated as an argument to objectives #boxed(color: theme.green, [*O-2.3.1*]) and #boxed(color: theme.green, [*O-2.3.2*]).

// The general approach for integrating global planning with the original approach by@gbpplanner is described in @s.m.global-planning. The results of the carried out method from this section are presented in @s.r.study-3.

The introduction to the thesis will be structured as follows. First,  #nameref(<intro-motivation>, "Motivation") presents the motivation for the thesis, then the problem definition is outlined in @intro-problem-definition. With the motivation and problem definition stated clearly, the research aspects are presented in #numref(<intro-research-hypothesis>)-#numref(<intro-research-objectives>). The software devloped for this project can generally be found at the GitHub organization #link("https://github.com/AU-Master-Thesis","AU-Master-Thesis"). This includes the repository for #acr("MAGICS") found at #gbp-rs(content: "AU-Master-Thesis/gbp-rs"), and other forked repositories. Lastly, individual contributions by each author are presented in @appendix.contributions.

Produced an interactive simulation tool, that can work as a tool to more easierly explore the future algorithms and variations on using GBP as a method for distributed path planning.

A valuable tool that can be used by others, e.g. companies to quickly assess if the gbpplanner algorithm is a suitable method for doing multi-agent distributed path planning given their requirements, such as density of robots, and environment structure.

#todo[answer all hypotheses]

// On hypothesis 3
// Extending the original GBP Planner software with a global planning layer will extend
// the actorsâ€™ capability to move in complex environments, without degradation to the re-
// produced local cooperative collision avoidance, while maintaining a competitive level
// of performance. Furthermore, to this end, a new type of factor can be added to the GBP
// factor graphs to aid in path-following.

// Accompanying research questions:
// RQ-3.1 Will global planning improve the actors' capability to move in complex environments?
// RQ-3.2 Will global planning degrade the existing local cooperative collision avoidance?
// RQ-3.3 What impact will the global planning layer have on performance?

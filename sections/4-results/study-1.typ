This plot illustrates the relationship between the input flowrate $Q_("in")$ the output flowrate $Q_("out")$ robots for the *Junction* scenario @s.r.scenarios.junction. The dashed black line represents the ideal scenario where $Q_("in") = Q_("out")$. The solid lavender colored line with circle markers#sl indicates the average flowrate measured over a 50-second period. The results demonstrate a close approximation to the ideal flowrate, with slight deviations observed at higher flowrates.

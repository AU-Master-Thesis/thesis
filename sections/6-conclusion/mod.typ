Produced an interactive simulation tool, that can work as a tool to more easierly explore the future algorithms and variations on using GBP as a method for distributed path planning.

A valuable tool that can be used by others, e.g. companies to quickly assess if the gbpplanner algorithm is a suitable method for doing multi-agent distributed path planning given their requirements, such as density of robots, and environment structure.

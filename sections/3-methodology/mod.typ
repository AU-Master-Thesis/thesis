= Methodology <methodology>


This section covers the methodology and work produced as part of the thesis. The different work items related to each hypothesis in @intro-research-hypothesis, will be presented in turn.

All work on the reproduction part is done by assessment of the openly available material i.e. the paper@gbpplanner and available source code distributed along with it@gbpplanner-code. Where certain parts of the algorithm are stated in an ambiguous way in the available material an argument for the chosen interpretation will be made.

// Where ambiguities arise, explanations or arguments for the chosen interpretations are provided.

// Where behaviour is not self evident, and not described in both the paper@gbpplanner and the source code@gbpplanner-code a point will be made with a clear reference to the source from which the knowledge was derived from.



// No communication exchange has been made with the authors

// #todo[
//   Talk about the reproduction aspects, what methodologies have we used to reproduce the paper?

  abstract: Path Planning is one of the vital aspects in autonomous system. In path planning, safety is important issue that should be taken into account in order to ensure a robot reaches at the target location without collision with surrounding obstacles. Moreover, there are important aspects that need to be addressed in path planning; computational time, optimal path and completeness. One of the popular methods for path planning is Potential field. Potential filed method is capable to overcome unknown scenario, taking into account the realities of the current environment of the robot motion. Two type of forces involved in potential field method; attractive force generated by goals and repulsive force generated by obstacles. However, this method has a major drawback due to local minima problem. This paper reviews the traditional artificial potential field theory that has been modified with variety of algorithms based on potential field method that have been implemented to upgrade the potential function performance in obstacle avoidance and local minima problem.

  abstract: A path-planning algorithm for the classical mover's problem in three dimensions using a potential field representation of obstacles is presented. A potential function similar to the electrostatic potential is assigned to each obstacle, and the topological structure of the free space is derived in the form of minimum potential valleys. Path planning is done at two levels. First, a global planner selects a robot's path from the minimum potential valleys and its orientations along the path that minimize a heuristic estimate of the path length and the chance of collision. Then, a local planner modifies the path and orientations to derive the final collision-free path and orientations. If the local planner fails, a new path and orientations are selected by the global planner and subsequently examined by the local planner. This process is continued until a solution is found or there are no paths left to be examined. The algorithm solves a much wider class of problems than other heuristic algorithms and at the same time runs much faster than exact algorithms (typically 5 to 30 min on a Sun 3/260).{<}{>}

  abstract: Based on a rigorous mathematical analysis, the authors present a systematic overview and a critical discussion of the inherent problems of potential field methods (PFMs). The authors previously (1989) developed a PFM called the virtual force field (VFF) method. Much insight has been gained into the strengths and weaknesses of this method. Four distinct drawbacks with PFMs are identified. Because of these drawbacks, the authors abandoned potential field methods and developed a new method for fast obstacle avoidance. This method, called the vector field histogram method, produces smooth, nonoscillatory motion, while sampling time and hardware are identical to those used in the VFF method.{<}{>}

  abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently attracted the attention of researchers due to their numerous potential civilian applications. However, current robot navigation technologies need further development for efficient application to various scenarios. One key issue is the "Sense and Avoid" capability, currently of immense interest to researchers. Such a capability is required for safe operation of UAVs in civilian domain. For autonomous decision making and control of UAVs, several path-planning and navigation algorithms have been proposed. This is a challenging task to be carried out in a 3D environment, especially while accounting for sensor noise, uncertainties in operating conditions, and real-time applicability. Heuristic and non-heuristic or exact techniques are the two solution methodologies that categorize path-planning algorithms. The aim of this paper is to carry out a comprehensive and comparative study of existing UAV path planning algorithms for both methods. Three different obstacle scenarios test the performance of each algorithm. We have compared the computational time and solution optimality, and tested each algorithm with variations in the availability of global and local obstacle information.

  abstract: The artificial potential field (APF) methods provide simple and efficient motion planners for practical purposes. However, these methods have a local minimum problem, which can trap an object before reaching its goal. The local minimum problem is sometimes inevitable when an object moves in unknown environments, because the object cannot predict local minima before it detects obstacles forming the local minima. The avoidance of local minima has been an active research topic in the potential field based path planing. In this study, we propose a new concept using a virtual obstacle to escape local minima that occur in local path planning. A virtual obstacle is located around local minima to repel an object from local minima. We also propose the discrete modeling method for the modeling of arbitrary shaped objects used in this approach. This modeling method is adaptable for real-time path planning because it is reliable and provides lower complexity.

  abstract: Potential field is a reactive method that has been used for trajectory control of mobile robots. In this method the robot behaves like a particle moving under the influence of an artificial potential produced by the target and the obstacles. This method has lower computational cost than others that utilize maps as a world model. However, one problem or this method is that it can generate regions of local minima. In these regions the driving force vanishes due to specific obstacle and goal configurations and the robot gets trapped. The use of harmonic functions for the potential calculation can solve this problem. In the harmonic function method the environment is represented by a grid, in which cells with an obstacle have their potential value set to 1 whereas cells that contain the target have their potential value set to 0. A relaxation algorithm is then employed to calculate the harmonic potential among the obstacles and the target. These two techniques have been applied in robot soccer environment to develop game strategies. Results obtained show that both techniques present better results when compared to the standard strategy or the FIRA Simulator. Further, a comparison of these techniques is presented for showing the advantages and disadvantages existing in each one of them.

  abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used in team for detecting targets and keeping them in its sensor range. There are various algorithms available for searching and monitoring targets. The complexity of the search algorithm increases if the number of nodes is increased. This paper focuses on multi UAVs path planning and Path Finding algorithms. Number of Path Finding and Search algorithms was applied to various environments, and their performance compared. The number of searches and also the computation time increases as the number of nodes increases. The various algorithms studied are Dijkstra’s algorithm, Bellman Ford’s algorithm, Floyd-Warshall’s algorithm and the AStar algorithm. These search algorithms were compared. The results show that the AStar algorithm performed better than the other search algorithms. These path finding algorithms were compared so that a path for communication can be established and monitored.

  abstract: Breakthroughs in genetic fuzzy systems, most notably the development of the Genetic Fuzzy Tree methodology, have allowed fuzzy logic based Artificial Intelligences to be developed that can be applied to incredibly complex problems. The ability to have extreme performance and computational efficiency as well as to be robust to uncertainties and randomness, adaptable to changing scenarios, verified and validated to follow safety specifications and operating doctrines via formal methods, and easily designed and implemented are just some of the strengths that this type of control brings. Within this white paper, the authors introduce ALPHA, an Artificial Intelligence that controls flights of Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles in aerial combat missions within an extreme-fidelity simulation environment. To this day, this represents the most complex application of a fuzzy-logic based Artificial Intelligence to an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle control problem. While development is on-going, the version of ALPHA presented withinwas assessed by Colonel (retired)Gene Lee who described ALPHA as “the most aggressive, responsive, dynamic and credible AI (he’s) seen-to-date.” The quality of these preliminary results in a problem that is not only complex and rife with uncertainties but also contains an intelligent and unrestricted hostile force has significant implications for this type of Artificial Intelligence. This work adds immensely to the body of evidence that this methodology is an ideal solution to a very wide array of problems.

  abstract: This paper is concerned with efficient derivation of the medial axis transform of a 2D polygonal region. Instead of using the shortest distance to the region border, a potential field model is used for computational efficiency. The region border is assumed to be charged and the valleys of the resulting potential field are used to estimate the axes for the medial axis transform. The potential valleys are found by following the force field, thus, avoiding 2D search. The potential field is computed in closed form using equations of the border segments. The simple Newtonian potential is shown to be inadequate for this purpose. A higher order potential is defined which decays faster with distance than the inverse of distance. It is shown that as the potential order becomes arbitrarily large, the axes approach those computed using the shortest distance to the border. Algorithms are given for the computation of axes, which can run in linear parallel time for part of the axes having initial guesses. Experimental results are presented for a number of examples.

  abstract: Graphical models such as factor graphs allow a unified approach to a number of key topics in coding and signal processing such as the iterative decoding of turbo codes, LDPC codes and similar codes, joint decoding, equalization, parameter estimation, hidden-Markov models, Kalman filtering, and recursive least squares. Graphical models can represent complex real-world systems, and such representations help to derive practical detection/estimation algorithms in a wide area of applications. Most known signal processing techniques -including gradient methods, Kalman filtering, and particle methods -can be used as components of such algorithms. Other than most of the previous literature, we have used Forney-style factor graphs, which support hierarchical modeling and are compatible with standard block diagrams.

  abstract: Energy-Based Models (EBMs) capture dependencies between variables by as- sociating a scalar energy to each configuration of the variab les. Inference consists in clamping the value of observed variables and finding config urations of the re- maining variables that minimize the energy. Learning consists in finding an energy function in which observed configurations of the variables a re given lower energies than unobserved ones. The EBM approach provides a common theoretical frame- work for many learning models, including traditional discr iminative and genera- tive approaches, as well as graph-transformer networks, co nditional random fields, maximum margin Markov networks, and several manifold learning methods. Probabilistic models must be properly normalized, which sometimes requires evaluating intractable integrals over the space of all poss ible variable configura- tions. Since EBMs have no requirement for proper normalization, this problem is naturally circumvented. EBMs can be viewed as a form of non-probabilistic factor graphs, and they provide considerably more flexibility in th e design of architec- tures and training criteria than probabilistic approaches .

  abstract: 'This paper reports the novel insight that the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) information matrix is exactly sparse in a delayed-state framework. Such a framework is used in view-based representations of the environment that rely upon scan-matching raw sensor data to obtain virtual observations of robot motion with respect to a place it has previously been. The exact sparseness of the delayed-state information matrix is in contrast to other recent feature-based SLAM information algorithms, such as sparse extended information filter or thin junction-tree filter, since these methods have to make approximations in order to force the feature-based SLAM information matrix to be sparse. The benefit of the exact sparsity of the delayed-state framework is that it allows one to take advantage of the information space parameterization without incurring any sparse approximation error. Therefore, it can produce equivalent results to the full-covariance solution. The approach is validated experimentally using monocular imagery for two datasets: a test-tank experiment with ground truth, and a remotely operated vehicle survey of the RMS Titanic.'

  note: 'Comment: 76 pages, 26 figures, to appear in International Journal of Robotics Research'
  abstract: During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts.

  abstract: Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are popular in motion planning because they find solutions efficiently to single-query problems. Optimal RRTs (RRT*s) extend RRTs to the problem of finding the optimal solution, but in doing so asymptotically find the optimal path from the initial state to every state in the planning domain. This behaviour is not only inefficient but also inconsistent with their single-query nature.

  abstract: We introduce the concept of a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) as a randomized data structure that is designed for a broad class of path planning problems. While they share many of the bene cial properties of existing randomized planning techniques, RRTs are specifically designed to handle nonholonomic constraints (including dynamics) and high degrees of freedom. An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed. To date, we have successfully applied RRTs to holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.

  abstract: Random number generators are a key element for various applications, such as computer simulation, statistical sampling, and cryptography. They are used to generate/derive cryptographic keys and non-repeating values, e.g., for symmetric or public key cyphers. The strength of a data protection system against cyber attacks corresponds to the strength of the weakest point in the security chain. Therefore, from a mathematical point of view, the security chain can be compromised even if the strongest algorithm is implemented. In fact, if the system requires keys or other random values and the generation process shows a certain vulnerability, the security of the system itself can be compromised. In this article, we present the most reliable tools and methodologies and the main standardisation efforts in the field of computer security to assess the quality of random number generators and ensure that they can be applied to computer security applications by offering adequate security strength. We offer a comprehensive guide that can be used as a quick and practical reference by developers of random number generators of any type to evaluate the random bit streams generated by implemented modules and determine whether or not they can be used in cybersecurity applications. Finally, we also present some use cases to which we applied the presented approach.

== Rapidly Exploring Random Trees <s.b.rrt>

#acr("RRT") is a sampling-based path planning algorithm, introduced by Steven M. LaValle in 1998@original-rrt. The algorithm incrementally builds a tree of nodes, each node a specific step length, $s$, from the last. The tree is built by randomly sampling a point in the configuration space, and then extending the tree towards that point with $s$. See the entire algorithm in @alg-rrt.@original-rrt@sampling-based-survey @ex.rrt goes through an contextual example of the algorithm.

  === RRT Functions
  This section provides a mathematical description of the functions used in the RRT algorithm; functions `SampleRandomPoint`, `NearestNeighbor`, `Steer`, `CollisionFree`, and `WithinGoalTolerance`. As in @alg-rrt, the #acr("RRT") tree consists of vertices, $V$, and edges, $E$; together composing a graph, $G = (V, E)$. These denotations are used in the following descriptions.@erc-rrt-star

  // \ #text(size: 1.25em, weight: "bold", [`SampleRandomPoint()`])  \
  ==== `SampleRandomPoint() -> x`
  This functions takes no arguments, and returns a random point, $x$, in the configuration space. Most commonly this is done by drawing from a uniform distribution. Say that $omega$ is an element in the set of all possible states in the configuration space $Omega$, where $forall omega in Omega$ equation @eq.func-sample-random-point holds.@erc-rrt-star

  #{
    show regex("(SampleRandomPoint|NearestNeighbor|Steer|CollisionFree|WithinGoalTolerance)"): set text(theme.mauve, font: "JetBrainsMono NF", size: 0.85em)
    [
      $
        "SampleRandomPoint" : omega arrow.r.bar {"SampleRandomPoint"_i (omega)}_(i in NN_0) subset cal(X)
      $<eq.func-sample-random-point>
    ]
  }

  That is; the set of all randomly sampled points, $cal(X)_"rand"$, which is the result of the above mapping, is a subset of the configuration space, $cal(X)$.

  // #jens[finish this one, it doesn't make too much sense]

  // \ #text(size: 1.25em, weight: "bold", [`NearestNeighbor(G, x)`])  \
  ==== `NearestNeighbor(G, x) -> v`
  Finds the nearest node $v in V subset cal(X)$ in the tree to a given point. Takes in the graph, $G = (V, E)$, and a point, $x in cal(X)$, see @eq.func-nearest-neighbor. This notion could be further specified with a distance metric, such as the Euclidean distance, as seen in @eq.func-nearest-neighbor-euclidean, which return the node $v in V$ that minimizes the distance, $norm(x - v)$, between the new point $x$ and an existing node $v$.@erc-rrt-star

      $<eq.func-nearest-neighbor-euclidean>
    ]
  }

  // \ #text(size: 1.25em, weight: "bold", [`Steer(x, y)`])  \
  ==== `Steer(x, y, s) -> v`
  Creates a new node at a specific distance from the nearest node towards a given point. Takes in two points $x, y in cal(X)$, and a step length $s in RR^+$,. The new node $v$ is created by moving $s$ distance from $x$ towards $y$. This way equation @eq.func-steer returns a point $v in cal(X)$ such that $v$ is closer to $y$ than $x$, which will either be $s$ closer, or if the randomly sampled point $y$ is within $s$ distance from $x$ to begin with, $v$ will be at $y$. As such the inequality $norm(z - y) >= s$ holds.@erc-rrt-star

    ]
  }

  // \ #text(size: 1.25em, weight: "bold", [`CollisionFree(x, y)`])  \
  ==== `CollisionFree(x, y) -> p`
  Checks if the path between two nodes is collision-free. Takes in two points $x, y in cal(X)$, and returns a boolean, $p in {top, bot}$. The returned values, $p$, says something about whether the addition of node $y in cal(X)$ into the #acr("RRT") tree is valid, given a proposed edge to the node $x in V$. Typically the validity notion depends on whether the path from $x$ to $y$ is collision-free, hence the function's name, but could include any other arbitrary constraints.@erc-rrt-star

  // \ #text(size: 1.25em, weight: "bold", [`WithinGoalTolerance(tolerance, x, goal)`])  \
  ==== `WithinGoalTolerance(t, x, g) -> p`
  Checks if a node is within the goal tolerance distance from the goal. As such the the functions takes in the distance tolerance $t$, a node $x in V$, and the goal state $g in cal(X)$. The function returns a boolean, $p in {top, bot}$, that tells us whether $x$ is within a euclidean distance $t$ from the goal state $g$. See @eq.func-goal-tolerance for the mathematical representation.@erc-rrt-star

  *Scenario:* Let's look at an example, where the possible state space is _two-dimensional euclidean space_. A Robot wants to go from 2D position $x_A$ to $x_B$ \ \

  *Input:* In @alg-rrt, the input is outlined to be a starting position, $x_"start"$, a goal position $x_"goal"$, a step length $s$, a maximum number of iterations, $N$, and lastly, a goal tolerance, $g_"tolerance"$. \ \

  *Output:* At the end of algorithm execution, the resulting graph is outputted as the combination of; $V$, the set of vertices, and $E$, the set of edges. \ \

  *Execution:*
  + $V$ is initialised to contain the initial position of the robot $x_"start" = x_A$, thus the set ${x_A}$. $E$ is initialised to be empty.
  + Enter a for loop, that will maximally run $N$ times, but will break early if the goal is reached.

    *Each iteration:*
    + A random point, $x_"random"$, is sampled from the configuration space, by calling the sampling function $"SampleRandomPoint"()$.
    + The nearest existing node in the tree, $x_"nearest"$, is found by $"NearestNeighbor"(G = (V, E), x_"random")$.
    + Thereafter, a new node, $x_"new"$, is created by making a new node $s$ distance from $x_"nearest"$ towards $x_"random"$ in the call to $"Steer"(s, x_"nearest", x_"random")$.

    *Checks:*
    + Only if the path from $x_"nearest"$ to $x_"new"$ is collision-free, the new node is added to the tree. Otherwise, continue to the next iteration.
    + If the node is added to the tree, and it is within $g_"tolerance"$ distance from $x_"goal"$, and the path from $x_"new"$ to $x_"goal"$ is collision-free, the goal is added to the tree, and the loop is broken.

== Optimal Rapidly Exploring Random Trees <s.b.rrt-star>

// FROM @erc-rrt-star
// In the year 2011, Sertac Karaman and Emilio Frazzoli in their paper Sampling-based Algorithms for Optimal Motion Planning, introduced three new path planning algorithms that improved upon the existing algorithms. These were, namely, optimal rapidly exploring random trees (RRT*), optimal probabilistic road mapping (PRM*), and rapidly exploring random graphs (RRG).

// The most popular algorithm among these is the RRT* algorithm, that is heavily based on the RRT algorithm, and has some improvisions, and provides a more optimal solution.

// Letâ€™s now look at the RRT* algorithm that was originally proposed in the paper along with the pseudo code. All the mathematical notations and functions in the paper are clearly explained here.

// The following image shows the RRT* algorithm applied on a 2D graph.

// Intuition HEADING

// The node sampling and selection process is exactly the same as RRT, wherein a point is randomly generated and a node is created at that point or at a specified maximum distance from the existing node, whichever is closer.

// However, the difference is where the connection is made. We assign every node a cost function that denotes the length of the shortest path from the start node. We then search for nodes inside a circle of given radius r centred at the newly sampled point.

// We then rearrange the connections such that they minimize the cost function and optimize the path. This can rearrange the graph in such a way that we get the shortest path.

// Courtesy: Joonâ€™s lectures

// In the image above, after rearranging the connections, the path to the green points, i.e.,
// is shorter through the red connections than through the earlier connections.

#acr("RRT*") is an extension of the #acr("RRT") algorithm, which was introduced in 2011 by Sertac Karaman and Emilio Frazzoli in their paper _Sampling-based Algorithms for Optimal Motion Planning_@sampling-based-survey. With only a couple of modifications to #acr("RRT"), the algorithm is able to reach asymptotic optimality, where the original algorithm makes no such promises. The modifications are explained below:

#set enum(numbering: box-enum.with(prefix: "M-", suffix: ":", color: theme.mauve))
+ _*Cost Function:*_ The first modification is the introduction of a _cost function_, $c(v)$, for each node, $v in V$. The cost function outputs the length of the shortest path from the start node to the node $v$. This modification encodes an optimisable metric for each branch, which enables the next modification, #boxed(color: theme.mauve, [*M-2*]), to take place.
+ _*Rewiring:*_ The second modification is the introduction of a _neighbourhood radius_, $r in RR^+$, around each newly created node, which is used to search for nodes that can be reached with a lower cost.

  As such every time a new node is created, there is a possibility that other nodes within that radius, will have a lower cost if they were to be connected to the new node. Thus, comparing the nodes' old cost, and the cost they would have in case we connect them to the newly created node, determines whether to rewire or not.

With the modifications made, the #acr("RRT*") algorithm is shown in @alg-rrt-star@erc-rrt-star.

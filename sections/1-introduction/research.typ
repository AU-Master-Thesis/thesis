// Jonas feedback:
// Reimplementing the original GBP Planner in a modern, flexible multi-agent simulator framework using an updated programming language will enhance the softwareâ€™s scientific communication and extendibility. This redevelopment will not only ensure fidelity in reproducing established results but also improve user engagement and development through advanced tooling, thereby significantly upgrading the usability and functionality for multi-agent system simulations.

// Previous:
// + Reproducing the results of the original #acr("GBP") Planner, with thought to its architecture and design, and in a new programming language will improve the software's scientific communication and its extensibility.

// Jonas feedback:
// We assert that the original work can be enhanced through precise modifications without interfering with the original work. Specifically, we introduce and rigorously test various GBP iteration schedules, and to strategically enhance the system by advancing towards a more distributed approach. These targeted improvements are expected to optimize performance and flexibility of system.

// Previous:
// + The original work can be improved without transforming it. Specifically, these improvements include testing different #acr("GBP") iteration schedules, and taking minor steps towards a more distributed approach.

// Updated with Jonas feedback
+ The original work can be enhanced through specific modifications without interfering with the original work's functionality. Specifically, we introduce and rigorously test various GBP iteration schedules, and strategically enhance the system by advancing towards a more distributed approach. These targeted improvements are expected to optimize flexibility and move towards a closer-to-reality system.

+ Extending the original #acr("GBP") Planner software with a global planning layer, will extend the actors' capability to move in complex environments without degradation to the reproduced local cooperative collision avoidance, while maintaining a competitive level of performance. To this end, a new type of factor can be added to the #acr("GBP") factor graphs to aid in path-following.

// Previous fourth hypothesis, merged with the first one
// + Extensive tooling will create a great environment for others to understand the software and extend it further. Furthermore, such tooling will make it easier to reproduce and engage with the developed solution software.

From this point on, anything pertaining to the context of #H(1) will be referred to as #study.H-1.full.s, #H(2) will be #study.H-2.full.s, #H(3) will be covered by #study.H-3.full.s.

=== Graph Representation <s.graph-representation>

#kristoffer[
  talk about how our graph representation is different from theirs.
  Ours is more faithful to how robots would represent the other robots in the environment
  compared to theirs, since they use bidirectional `std::shared_ptr`, which is not useable
  in a scenario where the algorithm run on different computer hosts, or just computer processes on the same host.

There are several different ways of representing graph structures in computer memory. Each with its own advantages and disadvantages. As explained in @s.b.factor-graphs, the factorgraph structure is a bipartite graph with undirected edges.
Such a graph structure enforces little to no constraints on what kind of memory representation are possible to use #note.kristoffer[find citation for this statement]. In the original work by Patwardhan _et al._@gbpplanner an atypical structure is used #note.k[find citation to defend this claim]. They represent the graph with a C++ class called `FactorGraph`, which each robot instance inherit from. Variable and factor nodes are stored in two separate vectors; `factors_` and `variables_`, as shown in the top of @code.gbpplanner-factorgraph.

Edges between variable and factors are not stored as separate index values, but are instead implicitly stored by having each factor storing a `std::shared_ptr<Variable>` to every variable it is connected to. Complementary every variable stores a `std::shared_ptr<Factor>` to every factor it is connected to. This kind of structure is advantageous in that it easy access the neighbours of node, given only a handle to the node. For example to send messages to the neighbours of a node by directly invoking methods on the receiving node directly. This structural pattern however is diffecult to implement and discouraged in Rust due to its ownership model.

Firstly, background knowledge on related works is presented, in #numref(<s.b.related-works>), followed by a technical introduction to the underlying theory for this thesis. In @s.b.gaussian-models and #numref(<s.b.probabilistic-inference>), Gaussian models and probabilistic inference are introduced, respectively. These two topics are the theoretical base for understanding factor graphs and the corresponding methods for inference and reasoning about them, as detailed in sections #numref(<s.b.factor-graphs>)-#numref(<s.b.gaussian-belief-propagation>).

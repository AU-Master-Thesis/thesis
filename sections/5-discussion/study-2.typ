This part discusses, and evaluates the results of the contribution, which pertains to the second hypothesis, #study.H-2.box. This hypothesis specifically concerns the testing of two enhancements to the original `gbpplanner`, which have both been implemented in the #acr("MAGICS") tool. Namely, the effect of varying the number of both internal and external iterations in the #acr("GBP") inference process. Further, also providing a comparison of five different iteration schedules. The deliberations take place in the following sections; #numref(<s.d.iteration-amount>), #numref(<s.d.iteration-schedules>).


=== Iteration Amount <s.d.iteration-amount>
#k[hi]

=== Iteration Schedules <s.d.iteration-schedules>
#k[hello]

The introduction to the thesis will be structured as follows. First,  #nameref(<intro-motivation>, "Motivation") presents the motivation for the thesis, then the problem definition is outlined in @intro-problem-definition. With the motivation and problem definition stated clearly, the research aspects are presented in #numref(<intro-research-hypothesis>)-#numref(<intro-research-objectives>). The repository for the developed software can be found at #gbp-rs(content: "AU-Master-Thesis/gbp-rs"), and individual contributions by each authtor to the project is found in @appendix.contributions.
